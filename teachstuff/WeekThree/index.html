<!-- HTML has several containers that you can place elements inside of. They all have the same effect, but the different labels makes readability easier.  Here are the containers we discussed in class:

    - nav
    - header
    - footer
    - section
    - article
    - aside
    - div
    - footer

  Make sure you use the appropriate container. For instance, your header should be placed inside of the <header> element. A navigation menu should be placed inside the <nav> container. Advertisements or extra info on your site should be placed in an <aside>.
