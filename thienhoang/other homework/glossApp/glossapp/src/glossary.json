    {"Def":"Front-end developer = Front-end developers create the code that produces a web design. They primarily work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some front-end developers will also create the site designs, graphics, and layouts using tools like Photoshop � incorporating some of the graphic designer role.",

    {"Def":"Back-end developer = Back-end developers create the server systems and code that send data to a visitor�s browser and save data to the back-end for processing. They work in a server-side language that could include PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, or any number of other programming languages or a mix of languages",
    "firstLetter":"b"},
    {"Def":"Database developer. A database developer is a specialized backend developer. He creates databases, plans how data is stored, and tunes it all for maximum speed. There can be much overlap between the database developer and backend developer. Small teams might have one person do both. Database developers work closely with database administrators, who are in charge of the day-to-day operations of the databases and keeping them running.",

    {"Def":"Data scientist. Data scientists are a new role. They analyze all of the data from a website � such as an ecommerce store � and use that data to make technical and business recommendations. This could be, for example, recommending that �sales starting on Tuesday at 10:15 a.m. with a 10 percent discount will perform better and will increase average order value.� This role is highly specialized. It might not make sense for smaller companies. Oftentimes other team members can perform these duties.",

    {"Def":"User-interface designer. User-interface designers are specialized graphic designers who cross into the front-end developer role. They deal more with how a site works (its interface) than how it looks.

They aren�t used as much on ecommerce sites but are common on web applications.",
    "firstLetter":"u"},
    {"Def":"User-experience developer. User experience addresses how the site works for visitors. This often overlaps with graphic and user-interface designers. But user experience developers typically approach it differently. They are more concerned with the workflows and tasks that a visitor will perform and less concerned with the visual design.
