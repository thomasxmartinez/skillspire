    <h2>Fun Fun Function</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The fun fun function videos are pretty great. Here are some of the things I've learned:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>.filter</li>
        <ul>
            <li>.filter() will take an array and return only the items that fit 
                the given criteria.</li>
            <li>It does this by assigning true or false values to the items in the 
                aray in order to decide whether to include them in the new array.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>.map</li>
        <ul>
            <li>.map() will take an array and return all the items in the array, modified by 
                the given criteria.</li>
            <li>It does this by taking only part of the item, or modifying it in whatever
                way that you specified.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>.reduce</li>
        <ul>
            <li>.reduce() is a multi-purpose version of the above higher order functions.</li>
            <li>It can be used when either .map or .filter don't quite fit the problem</li>
            <li>It needs a bit more info to work, but can replace many for loops.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, I learned that he likes to use dragons for his examples.</p>

    <h2>This</h2>
    <p>"this" seems to have many purposes, kind of dependent on where in your code you use it.
        <br>
        It behaves slightly differently dependig on whether you have "use strict" set, and whether or not
        you are using arrow functions.
        <br>
        "this" generally referrs to the scope of whatever it is being called in, which means that
        the value it returns can change if you try to call anything using "this" while outside of its
        native object.
        <br>
        You can get around that issue by using "bind" to set the object of "this" back to its original object.
        <br>
        Does that make sense?
        <br>
        ...... yeah only sort of ... but that's okay for now I think.
